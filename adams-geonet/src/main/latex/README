======

Simply add a directory and a LaTex file with the same name in that directory
for automatic PDF generation from the LaTex source files.
For generating a manual, use the module's name as directory name, e.g.,
"adams-funky". This should have a directory/file structure as follows:

 +- main
    |
    +- latex
       |
       +- adams-funky
          |
          +- adams-funky.tex

This will create a PDF document called "adams-funky.pdf" in the target
directory.

Add this module's PDFs then to the adams-all and, if appropriate, to the
adams-ml module's assembly/bin.xml configuration file as well.
