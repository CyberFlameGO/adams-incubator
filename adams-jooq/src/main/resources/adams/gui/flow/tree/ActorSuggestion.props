# File for listing rules for suggesting actors in the flow editor.
#
# Format:
#   rulename = rule
#
# Rules adhere to the syntax described in adams.parser.ActorSuggestion.
# As "rulename" anything apart from "Default" can be used. In order to avoid
# name clashes with other modules, it is recommended to prefix the rules
# with the module name, e.g. "adams-core.rule1=...".
