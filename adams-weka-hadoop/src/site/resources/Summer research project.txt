Title of research project:
Performing distributed experiments using Hadoop

Abstract:
Great numbers of computing nodes in current computer networks
represent the perfect stage for large-scale, distributed experiments.
The well-known machine learning workbench WEKA though, in its current
stage, only offers limited support for distributed experiments, with
most people only running experiments on a single machine. Past
attempts of introducing distributed computation (Grid Weka,
Weka-Parallel) did not catch on. The Map/Reduce framework offers a
compelling approach to performing such distributed experiments. Based
on the widely used Apache Hadoop Java library, the student will
develop in a first step an experimentation framework for the WEKA
platform that allows the researcher to take advantage of the available
nodes in a computer cluster, reducing the time of completion for an
experiment to a minimum. In a second step, the student will integrate
this new functionality into the ADAMS machine learning and data mining
suite, enabling the researcher to set up experiments in a workflow
on-the-fly and execute these then in a distributed fashion.
